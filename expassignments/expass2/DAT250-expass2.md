I had quite a bit of trouble in this project, and will work on it in week 37 as well. 

**What I did**
- Cloned the repo from https://github.com/timKraeuter/dat250-jpa-example.
- At first I didn't manage to configure the project to run the main. After deleting and reinstalling IntelliJ it worked.
- Still, after running the program, I do not think it outputted the wanted results. Instead of the database tables, i got some weird files and folders. I have added them as a screenshot and you can also see them in the repo linked above.
- Nevertheless, I tried implementing the classes in part 2 of the assignment. 
- I'm not sure if i was on the right track.

**Problems**
- Outputting and inspecting the database.
